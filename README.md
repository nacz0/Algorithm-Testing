# Algorithm-Testing
A full-stack application designed to benchmark, test, and visualize various heuristic algorithms. The project is split into a React-based frontend and a Python-based backend.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into two main components:
- frontend/: The user interface for interacting with the algorithms and viewing results.
- server/: The backend engine where the heuristic logic and data processing reside.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v16.x or higher) & npm
- Python 3.x

## Installation

**Frontend Dependencies**

Navigate to the frontend directory and install the required npm packages:
```
cd frontend
npm install
```

## Running the Application
To run the project, you need to start both the backend and the frontend in separate terminal windows.

1. Start the Backend (Server)
```
cd server
python main.py

```

2. Start the Frontend (Development Mode)
```
cd frontend
npm run dev
```


## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, SCSS.
- Backend: Python, FastApi (WebSocket)
